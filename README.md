# Base_StateMachine_RTC_SDcard
An integration of the State Machine, Real-time Clock and SD card datalogging

Remaining issue: Need to decide if Excel can handle the summing or the code will do this. Further research into global variables needed, read the
notes on the the 'commit' for this revision of code.
